# JamiaHamdard_rpi-basics

This repository contains the scipts that were used for my initial projects on Raspberry Pi. These scripts were basically written to test each component separately like an LED, IR sensor, DC Motor and push button. These are all trivial scripts but may help if someone wants to do the same. The links for step by step procedure of projects associated with each script in this repository can be found below.

I. The step by step procedure of how to make an LED blink including the required harware connections along with the circuit diagrams can be found on - https://sites.google.com/site/projectsriza/blink-an-led

--Test script - led_blink.py

II. The complete procedure of using an IR module with Raspberry Pi to detect obstacles in range and black line on a white background can be found on - https://sites.google.com/site/projectsriza/ir-sensor-for-line-and-obstacle-detection

--Test script - sensor_test.py
